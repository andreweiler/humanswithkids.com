  <p>Hi, I'm Andrew and I've been thinking about people, how we connect with each other and the things we use to try to make us happy, for a very long time.</p>
  
  <p>You can probably learn a good bit about me by Googling me since I have a unique name, only Andrew Gertig I know of so far. What you may not learn from Google that I do want you to know is that I care about people.  As a believer I wonder if its because its natural to me or because of how much I know Christ loves each of us. Other than that one main thing there are plenty of things I love to do, most of all spending time with my wife and kid(s)! As the great philosopher Robin Scherbatsky once said "Every good relationship has a reacher and a settler." and I can assure you I'm the reacher.</p>

    If you want to read some more you certainly can but I'm warning you it's just fluff from here on.

    Cool factoid: I lived in Kingston, Jamaica until I was 16 years old, in fact I have Jamaican heritage that reaches back to the late 1800's. My dad is one of the coolest men alive today, he embodies so many of the traits that I seek to emulate as a father and as a man. My mom is an amazing woman, a super-carer, a fine-line-walker between letting her children figure things out on their own and being consumed with worry. I don't have very many childhood memories that are missing my mom.

    <p>While growing up I always had an interest in how the world worked and in particular how humans could build such amazing things. I caught the computer bug in the late eighties which manifested itself in the form of cardboard computers with paper floppy disks. Thankfully my uncle is a geek and he got us a machine running Windows 3.1.1 in '93. How I wish I was cool enough to tell you the processor Hertz and what the baud rate of the modem was, but I'm not (losing street cred as a geek quickly).

  <p>Even though I didn't finish my 9th grade tutoring class in Pascal and I never took my home PC apart to add more RAM I somehow still managed to walk away from college with a degree in Electrical Engineering. During college I worked for the Department of Energy (DoE) at a research lab called Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories (LLNL) on a space based missile defense program, then later I was able to work on tech that was used to see through the debris of the World Trade Center after 9/11 to search for heartbeats and breathing. Joining the military right as we invaded Iraq for the second, and hopefully last time, was a surreal experience. I'm proud of my service to my country and feel really lucky to have spent time in the Air Force where I got to do some crazy cool stuff.</p>

  <p>During college and the subsequent USAF time as an engineer I discovered that though I could do all the logic, analysis, design, you know the head work of it all, that being an engineer wasn't my passion.  I really enjoy people, I love building things, and I sometimes pretend not to but I love teaching. There I said it, I like teaching, though I frequently don't feel qualified to do so and worry I'm actually making things worse.</p>
  
  <p>Still figuring out what that means for the future. Right now I'm a mini-expert in the world of spine surgery, where I "caddy" for surgeons in the OR and get to educate surgeons on my products. Who knows what will be next, I sure don't.</p>
